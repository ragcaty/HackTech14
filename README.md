Tick-Tock acts as both a study aid and website tracker at the same time

~INSTALLATION~
Currently only supported in Google Chrome, go to the Chrome store and download our extension! From there go to your Tools->Extensions and turn it on. An icon should pop up next to the url bar if the extension has installed correctly. Go to the options page and set up what sites you want to block, and your time will start ticking down everytime you visit said website.
Alternatively, you can download the files from GitHub and use the 'Load unpacked extension' from the Extensions page in Chrome

~FEATURES~
*Tick-Tock will accept urls to block all sites with the same domain name (That means no going to www.reddit.com/r/* !) for a specified amount of time
*Time is only counted if the user is on the website tab - therefore if the page is showing, time will start counting down.
*When time runs out, any tabs in the current window will be closed automatically
*Additionally, Tick-Tock will keep track of time spent on any website in the window. Clicking on the analysis tab will display a graph showing your time spent respectively on the top 5 websites.
